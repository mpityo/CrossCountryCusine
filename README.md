# Cross Country Cuisine

Find great restaurants all across the county with this interactive restaurant search engine. Sort results by location, type of food, and cost. Searches are easily entered via the user interface, and results are displayed with pictures and relevant information for each restaurant. Users can store search data and favorite results to create a running list of restaurant experiences.

Feel free to refresh the page and come back whenever you need to check your search results, they'll stick around until you change or remove them.
